## Observation 3 focus more on the scope of the project
Contradictions run to wait, wait to run.
How time can punish us. In what situation can be get punished or forgiven.
Exemple waking up late, we have to run to take our bus/train but the train is delayed so we have more time. Time was forgiving this time.

## Object interaction ideas

Pulling a rope and making a clock arrow spining.
Making the rope cuttable, when you cut it, you end your story. it presses a button.

You can end your story by: 
- pulling the rope indefinitly until no more rope.
- Cutting it.

## Lose Lose scenario. Time for respect
Lose Lose: You waited. But it's too late now. You wait more it's bad, you stop waiting it's bad aswell.

## In which situation can it be "too late" and have consequences weither you do.

Scenario where you shouldn't have waited in the first place:

Either you act or you wait longer.

- Go late to sleep and not sleep.
stop waiting = sleep paralysis(may be triggered by lack of sleep and having undefined sleep cycle).
Waiting more = not sleeping.


- Go late to sleep and not sleep.
- get out the bed in the morning.
- take a nap longer that expected.

- Waiting for your last dish to cook. You cannot buy food anymore for today.
Stop Waiting = eating your burned food.
Waiting more = bruning your food to dust.

- Waiting for your last bus.
- Waiting more = miss the bus so you end up havin a bad night.
- Stop waiting take the bus but 

Transports:
- Taking the train. Run to take it but it's delayed, worst it is deleted.
- Attendre l'ascenceur
