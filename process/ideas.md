## Time In Time Out Ideas

## What if ?

1) Suprising delay 

Snail effect: Long wait but surprinsing to receive. A snail is super slow, why you can't see him coming. And you're like " oh shit there's a snail !"

Informations takes longer to arrive ? if all messages/mails had a delay. Like if someone had to get to your position to talk to you.

Having a postman that manages all the messages/mails and deliver it to you once a day ? 

2) Confront your wait 

How much you're willing to invest your time to receive thoses messages ?
