## CRANK !
Main reference: "Crank" A hitman (Chev Chelios) who got poisoned and has to stay in movement to not die.

Basically. Chev Chelios, a guy that must move against his will, to stay alive. We can imagine weird scenario with that in mind. He must do things he cannot really do while moving. Waiting in line, WC, Eating/Drinking, Taking a crowded train, sleeping. Meditate and other weird things.

Weird exemples:

What if ?: Chev Chelios has a date in a restaurant, how would intercat to not die while eating all his meals.

In his case, staying still will be ephemeral. His default state is: Moving.
In my case it's the opposite: moving is ephemeral, My default state is staying chill.

## My datas 

Record myself everyday. My Moving habits: Each day has an average scenario which can be defined by speed and the time I'm in movement. Sometimes events happen and breaks this average habits.  Per day, I have 4 hours ~ which I'm in a movement whatever speed I'm at. Daily routine can be associated with that.

"if you know the now you can know the near future" but some elements breaks that perspective (when there is more complex parameters) and therefore we have to make probability instead of total assumption.
