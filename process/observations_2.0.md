Main reference: "Crank" A hitman (Chev Chelios) who got poisoned and has to stay in movement to not die.

Basically. Chev Chelios, a guy that must move against his will, to stay alive. We can imagine weird scenario with that in mind. He must do things he cannot really do while moving. Waiting in line, WC.


Chev Chelios as Chev Chelios: Entity that depends on movement to survive.

Chev Chelios as an object: Cannot exist without being in movement.

Chev Chelios as an function: Cannot be used without being in movement.

Chev Chelios as a scene: Only be viewed/lived while in mouvement.

Chev Chelios as an habit: Always moving, stopping is not wanted.

Chev Chelios as a feeling: feeling emotions with mouvement (europa park).

What's/Who's the Chev Chelios ? 
What's/Who's the obstacles ?  
What's does it do ? 

Concepts:

Chaos and habits.
Moving and not moving.
stopping and not to stop.
"As fast as possible and slowly as necessary".


My first Observations:

Record myself everyday. My Moving habits: Each day has an average scenario which can be defined by speed and the time I'm in movement. Sometimes events happen and breaks this average habits.

Chaos theory in movement, determinism:
"if you know the now you can know the near future" but some elements breaks that perspective (when there is more complex parameters) and therefore we have to make probability instead of total assumption.


What's is not precisely controlled that slows/stops my movement during my habits?:

- Transports
- crowd
- slow people
- Apero time
- Eating / drinking time
- peepee poopoo time
- Traffic red lights
- Using a computer
- Snail on the road(helping him)


What's makes me keep moving during my habits ?:

- Arriving on time(For Work/Transports/For People)
- Getting basics needs(Food,WC)
- Going out smoking cigarrete
- Going Home
- 


What can be stopping/slowing my movement in general ?:

- a door
- portals in stores
- automatic walls/doors
- public transport (trains/bus/planes/boats)
- Driving
- 

What keeps me moving ?:

What's my Chev Chelios ? Determinism
What's the obstacles ? Slow Chaos
What's does it do ? happy accident



Routine de déplacement: qu'est-ce qui provoque des contradictions dans mon déplacement.

Utiliser des contradictions sur du mouvement attendu et pas stable.

Qu'est que pourrait être les obstacles. Pourquoi ? ces contradictions happens
