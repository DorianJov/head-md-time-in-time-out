"Pattern-of-life analysis is not limited to one medium and can encompass anything in an individual's (or system of individuals') life: from their internet browsing habits, to a record of instances of choices made in order to determine a statistical favorite".

 "Pattern of life (POL) or behavior pattern describes a recurrent (e.g., normalcy) way of acting by an individual or group toward a given object or in a given situation. Usually, one has a specific POL, and this POL is repeatable".

## My position and speed patterns

Our time habits may be represented by position and speed.
We all have a routine, habits. We time control. 

Here are some data of "speed" routine.

1) Lausanne lane 5 to 7:
Dist: 160m
Time : 2min
Average Speed: 3km

2) Train Lausanne to Vufflens:
Dist: 11.20km
Time : 12:30m
Average Speed:65km/h

3) TrainStation to Mom's car
Dist: 90m
Time: 1m
Average Speed: 4km/h

4) (Car) Mom's car to home
Dist: 1.28 km
Time: 3:08
Average Speed: 27km/h

Realised I have not enough data. I looked for another app.

I can record the entire day and get a graph:











## Butterfly effect || Causality

How do we experience the domino effect in our life habits and how a sequence of events in time can results to something not wanted.
