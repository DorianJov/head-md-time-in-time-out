## Thinking about objects that you can pull/rotate

# Primary INPUT/OUTPUT:
INPUT:
- Rotatory encoder

OUTPUT:
- lenght, timeline


# Thread

INPUT: 
- pull the thread
OUTPUT: 
- Thread lenght
- Scissors -> cut the the thread

# Audio tape

INPUT:
- Pull the audio tape

OUTPUT:
- Radio, Melody, Sound, Story.

## first object idea "bomb" game:

Saw game:
- tirer la ficelle ressentir des vibrations. 
- attentation Ã  ne pas aller trop loin. sinon lost.

- who can give the more time ?
win based on the length of the thread.

or to win cut instantely the thread and don't play. dont play = don't activate the bomb
can "brain" the user with a buzzer makin stressing noise, making them feel its gonna explode 
tableau based on time.

if user goes too fast it explodes.
user has a bomb on himself
exploding buzzer
user shouldnt know much he pulled

HOW TO LOSE:
Too fast ||  Pulling the thread too much

HOW TO LOSE LESS:
Stoping before it explodes.
Try going further and further.

GOAL:
Get the longest thread. don't play too much with time.
Once you finished your experience you can see the thread length of other player.
Who gave the most time and who got the bigger respect

## Second IDEA

INPUT: 
- pull the thread
OUTPUT: 
- Thread lenght
- Vibrator
- dc motor
- Scissors -> cut the the thread

# Begin

Pull the string.

# Experience

Play Against the machine.
Try to get the longest thread.
But don't play too much you can lose everything.
