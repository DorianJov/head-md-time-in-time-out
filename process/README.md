## Time In Time Out || First Personal Reasearch

1) Research based on my own experiences and point of view:

## To the point
Today we are overconnected. We share our personal space and time with the entire world. But mostly we interact everyday with people that concern our life habits in that numeric shared space time.

Our communication methods have become so effective we can even speak with anyone while doing things we should do alone.

Always faster but never slower. 

## Exemples
Sleeping. People still talk to you, like whispers lost in the clouds... they'll eventually get to you when you're awake.

Finished work/school, you're at home but the task are still gettin to you, with email or messages. Even on breaks, there is something to remind you to work.

My dad "Even I'm not supposed to work, I must call them and responds for things".

We can get disconnected to present, we kind of lost capacity to wait and get bored, Since we are always solicited in a way or other. We cannot leave this system. No mail, no instant chat, you can't.

## How does it relate to time ?

We associate space and time to differents experiences and memories. Before, work was work at work. It's mixing.

Before instant message or acces on service, we must wait for it. Wait for a letter, wait for a bird, wait for a person.

When you receive a message, you may feel it's your duty to responds instantely. Therefor, it is kind of manipulating your actions and time. 

Application based on time optimisation. CFF can propose to use your currentLocation to travel. We don't have to, at least, know where we are and cheking the nearest bus stop 

## Internet cartography 

Internet is made with hiden cables underground and underseas
Thoses physical "routes" makes us connected.
There is new tech as well, Flyin plane, balloon, satellite.

## What if?

Informations takes longer to arrive ? if all messages/mails had a delay. Like if someone had to get to your position to talk to you.
