## To the point

1) Research based on my own experiences and point of view:

Today we are overconnected. We share our personal space and time with the entire world. But mostly we interact everyday with people that concern our life habits in that numeric shared space time.

Our communication methods have become so effective we can even speak with anyone while doing things we should do alone.

The fatest our digital interraction is, the more we are in between two space and time. It's overlapping. Always faster but never slower.


## Exemples
Sleeping. People still talk to you, like whispers lost in the clouds... they'll eventually get to you when you're awake.

Finished work/school, you're at home but the task are still gettin to you, with email or messages. Even on breaks, there is something to remind you to work. "Even I'm not supposed to work, I must call them and responds for things" - dad.

We can get disconnected to present, we kind of lost capacity to wait and get bored, Since we are always solicited in a way or other. We cannot leave this system. No mail ? no instant chat ? seems hard.

## How does it relate to time ?

We associate space and time to differents experiences and memories. Before, work was work at work. It's mixing.

Before instant message or acces on service, we must wait for it. Wait for a letter, wait for a bird, wait for a person.
And there was a special space dedicated to a specific communication system.

When you receive a message, you may feel it's your duty to responds instantely. Therefor, it is kind of manipulating your actions and time. 

Application based on time optimisation. CFF can propose to use your currentLocation to travel. We don't even have to know where we are anymore and cheking the nearest bus stop... 

## What if ?

Snail effect: Long wait but surprinsing to receive. A snail is super slow, why you can't see him coming. And you're like " oh shit there's a snail !"

Informations takes longer to arrive ? if all messages/mails had a delay. Like if someone had to get to your position to talk to you.

Having a postman that manages all the messages/mails and deliver it to you once a day ?
