# Time respect

Our personal time is governed with dualism. Running to wait, wait to run. To be as fast as possible and slowly as necessary.
We give our time and Time can punish or forgive. Woke up late ? Train is delayed, still catch the train. Time was nice today. In this puzzle game, you must pull
a string. This string is your time. How far can you go ? But careful, don't play too much with it, you might lose everything. Timing respect.
