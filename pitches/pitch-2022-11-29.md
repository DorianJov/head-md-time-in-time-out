Time for respect

Our personal time is governed with dualism. Running to wait, wait to run. To be as fast as possible and slowly as necessary.
We give our time and Time can punish or forgive. But when it's already too late, How do you chose between a lose lose situation. What could be the worst choice. Do you give more or stop giving ? Timing respect, don't play to much with it.
