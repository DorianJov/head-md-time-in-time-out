Time for respect

Our personal time is governed with dualism. Running to wait, wait to run. To be as fast as possible and slowly as necessary.
We give our time and Time can punish us or forgive. But when it's already too late, How do you chose between a lose lose situation. What could be the worse choice. Do you give more or stop giving ? Timing respect.
