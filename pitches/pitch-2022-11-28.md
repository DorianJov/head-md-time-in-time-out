Time for respect

In this constant moving space, Time can be punishing or forgiving.
Our personal time is governed with dualism. Running to wait, wait to run. To be as fast as possible and slowly as necessary. What this entity want from us ? To be on time, we run and we wait. How to earn it's respect and have a good fortune.
The only way of receiving a blessing is to offer your time. but you can be punished as well.
