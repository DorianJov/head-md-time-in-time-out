Time for respect

In this constant moving space, Time can be punishing or forgiving.
Our personal time is governed with dualism. Running to wait, wait to run. To be as fast as possible and slowly as necessary. What this entity want from us ? To be on time, we run and we wait. How to earn it's respect and have a good fortune.
The only way of receiving a blessing is to have the feeling of losing your time but you can be punished as well.

 Focus object: time that is like you give part of yourself

 Fil que l'on tire, comment lhistoire se change en fonction du temps quon donne et quelle sont les conséquences d'arrêter d'attendre et ne plus attendre.

 Ex: Attendre l'ascenceur et tout devient sombre et silencieux.

 Wait...Wait...Ah sh*t,it's to late now = base story.
 stop waiting  = consequences.
 waiting more = consequences.
 Chosing what is the less bad.
